Given an array of n integers to check if there exist integer m >= 2
such that for every ai % m will make the all array equal.
Solution : check if the gcd difference is greater than 1.


In Maximum subarray sum problems check if the empty arrays are allowed because if it is not
the neutral value of node is not (sum = pre = suf = ans = 0)
it will be (sum = 0 , pre = suf = ans = -infLL)

Some problem depend on that the operation described will acur few number of times
so always when you see a new operation check its limits


given and array a of length 2^n calculate a value v as follows:
Take pairs of adjacent elements and replace them with their minimum.
On the next step, take pairs of the new sequence and replace them with their maximum.
Repeat alternating min and max until only one number remains. That number is v.
You are given m queries.
1 index value -> a[index] = value
2 left right -> value
Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 17 (sequence length is 2^n)

0 ≤ a[i], b ≤ 10^9

1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ p ≤ 2^n



given string s of length n and q queries of three types
1 l r flip all brackets in range [l , r]
2 i flib the bracket at index i
3 l r what is the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence in range [l , r]

1 <= n , q <= 1e6
